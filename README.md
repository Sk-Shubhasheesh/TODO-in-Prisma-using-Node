# What are ORMs ?
* ORMs let you easily interact with your database without worrying too much about the underlying syntax (SQL language for eg)

# Why ORMs ?
1. Simpler syntax (converts objects to SQL queries under the hood)
![alt text](<README Folder/orm.png>)

2. Abstraction that lets you flip the database you are using. Unified API irrespective of the DB

3. Type safety/Auto completion
![alt text](<README Folder/type.png>)

4. Automatic migrations
* In case of a simple Postgres app, it’s very hard to keep track of all the commands that were ran that led to the current schema of the table.
```.sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN phone_number VARCHAR(15);
```
* As your app grows, you will have a lot of these CREATE  and ALTER  commands.
ORMs (or more specifically Prisma) maintains all of these for us.

# What is Prisma 
![alt text](<README Folder/prisma.png>)

### 1. Data model
* In a single file, define your schema. What it looks like, what tables you have, what field each table has, how are rows related to each other.

### 2. Automated migrations
* Prisma generates and runs database migrations based on changes to the Prisma schema. 

### 3. Type Safety
* Prisma generates a type-safe database client based on the Prisma schema.

###  4. Auto-Completion

#  Installing prisma in a fresh app

#### Initialize an empty Node.js project
```.js
npm init -y
```
#### Add dependencies
```.js
npm install prisma typescript ts-node @types/node --save-dev
```
#### Initialize typescript
```.js
npx tsc --init
Change `rootDit` to `src`
Change `outDir` to `dist`
```
#### Initialize a fresh prisma project
```.js
npx prisma init
```

# How me Generate the Migration ?
* You have created a single schema file. You haven’t yet run the CREATE TABLE  commands. To run those and create migration files , run 
```.js
npx prisma migrate dev --name Initialize the schema
```
